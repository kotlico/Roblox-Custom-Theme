# Roblox-Custom-Theme
## the name speaks for itself
this is an theme i made for my userContent.css but it can be used for many other things (things that i don't know)

it uses [decay colorscheme ](https://github.com/decaycs/decaycs)

# How to use it
## pretty simple just make an userChrome and then copy and paste this code

## there could be a second method thru using the @import url(), but, sadly i am too lazy and dumb to find out how to, so just fiddle with this as it is
